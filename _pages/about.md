Hello!
My name is Trân Xuân Đạt, born on May 18, 2006. I am currently a first-year student in the Talent Bachelor Program in Computer Science at the University of Information Technology (UIT). My academic journey has been marked by notable achievements, including earning third prize in the 2024 National Excellent Student Contest in Chemistry.

However, with a strong foundation in problem-solving and analytical thinking, I am deeply passionate about exploring cutting-edge advancements in artificial intelligence and software development. I aspire to leverage these fields to address real-world challenges and drive innovation in technology.

I am eager to engage in collaborative projects, expand my technical expertise, and contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving tech landscape.
